##Intro

Fear the IOC (International Olympic Committee) is a bookmarklet that censors any text or images that the IOC may find litigious.

##How does it work?

Fear the IOC blacks out any text or images that includes a word that the IOC may consider an infringement). It is built on Bartek Szopka’s ([jQuery highlight plugin](http://bartaz.github.com/sandbox.js/jquery.highlight.html) (based on work by [Johann Burkard](http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html)). It was turned into a bookmarklet using this excellent [jQuery Bookmarklet Generator.](http://bender.fesb.hr/~robert/jquery-bookmarklet-generator/)

##Why

Fear the IOC was created for the first [pebble {code}](http://pebblecode.com/) hack day as a fun little project. The seed of the idea came from this [lovely guardian article.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/13/olympics-2012-branding-police-sponsors)
