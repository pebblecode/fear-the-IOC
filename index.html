  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>Fear the IOC blacks out any text or images that includes a word that the IOC may consider an infringement. It is built on Bartek Szopka’s (<a href="http://bartaz.github.com/sandbox.js/jquery.highlight.html" target="_blank">jQuery highlight plugin</a> (based on work by <a href="http://johannburka/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html" target="_blank">Johann Burkard</a>). It was turned into a bookmarklet using the nodejs application in the <a href="bookmarklet_generator" target="_blank">bookmarklet_generator</a> folder.</p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Fear the IOC was created for the first <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> hack day as a fun little project. The seed of the idea came from this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/13/olympics-2012-branding-police-sponsors" target="_blank">lovely guardian article.</a></p>
  <div class="disclaimer">
    <h3>*disclaimer*</h3>
    <i>One of the main aims of this project was for me to get a little better at using jQuery, which I’m just starting out with. Therefore the bookmarklet may not work on some/any sites. </i>
    <h3>*disclaimer two*</h3>
    <i>This project is not intended to infringe upon anyone's legal rights or cause any offence  (IOC or otherwise).</i>
